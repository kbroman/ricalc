These are Mathematica notebooks (and pdf versions of them) that
provide the details of the simpler algebraic calculations we performed
to get 2- and 3-pt probabilities for RILs.


meiosis_3pt     Three-point probabilities for meiotic products.

RIL_selfing     Two- and three-point probabilities for 2-way, 4-way,
                and 8-way RILs by selfing.

RIL_X_2w_3pt    Coincidence-type quantity for the X chromosome in
                two-way RILs by sibling mating.

RIL_A_2w_3pt    Coincidence-type quantity for the X chromosome in
                two-way RILs by sibling mating.
